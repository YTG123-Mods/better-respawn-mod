# Crying Obsidian Mod

## Features

1. Adds a "Crying Obsidian" block, which changes your spawnpoint.
1. Adds a "Portable Crying Obsidian" item, which changes your spawnpoint as well.
1. Both can be used to get into places in the overworld which you can't normally get to. That is using the nether or the end.
